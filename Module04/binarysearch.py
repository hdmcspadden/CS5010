Directions: Write an algorithm for a binary search using the instructions below.
   
def BinarySearch(item_list,target):
   
Inputs:
 
A list
An element (target value)
Output:
 
A sequence of indices (of mid) compared to the target value [This can be a simple print statement embedded within your binarySearch function. It doesnâ€™t have to be a value that is returned.]
True or False [This has to be returned by the function.]

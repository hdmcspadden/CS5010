Write some code using try-except-finally blocks that has the potential to throw a lot of errors. 
Include the following "except" blocks: 
 
*Exception (all built-in exceptions are derived from this class â€” yes, it's simply called "Exception")
*TypeError
*ValueError
*ZeroDivisionError
*FileNotFoundError
*IOError
ArithmeticError
Your task is to figure out the appropriate order of these "except" blocks so that 
no "except" block is unreachable.
 
Test your code out by running it multiple times and allowing your code to encounter various kinds of exceptions (you can do this by incorporating user input or otherwise.) Have unique bodies of code in each of the "except" blocks (at the very least, different print() statements), and run your code enough times and force your code to encounter the various kinds of exceptions such that output from EACH "except" block is printed, proving that no "except" block is unreachable.

# Data 
'''
What is data?
    Data is raw, unprocessed, and uninterpreted information
    It is an abstract concept
    
    Set of qualitative and quantitative values
    
    My answer: Data is an attempt by humans to count, measure, and categorize the world around us to make associations and predictions and make sense of the human condition.
    
    
Different types of data
    Qualitative
        Descriptive information (relates to the quality of something)
        Example: Nae: Edgar Codd

    Quantitative data

        Discrete data
            Numerical information
            Can only take certain values (whole numbers, “counted”)
            An example: Year Born: 1980
        
        Continuous data
            Numerical information
            Continuous range (often “measured”)
            Example: Size: 227.0 cm
            
        Categorical
            A limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values to describe an item 
            (giving an item a “label” or placing into a “category”)
            Blood type is an example.
            Example: "Role: Drummer"
            Example: Year Born: 1980
            
Properties of data

    Source – where did the data come from? Trustworthy? Unbiased? Reliable? Sufficient?

    Quality – data is maintained and data is clean
        Sometimes means no missing data, correct labels, data types, and data in useable format.

    Scale – data is representative?
        Is there enough data to draw meaningful conclusions?
        Is it representative of the domain in question
        Does more data need to be obtained? Can it be obtained?

    Variety – different types of data
        Can it provide, for example, offline, online, personal,
        anonymous, mobile, PC, branded, blended, demo, interest
        and/or intent data?

        Depending on context/situation this may be on of the
        more important factors…

    Value of data is extracted through context and presentation
        Case studies (case studies are used to provide context, while no direct questions on these will be asked on the exam, you can use them to provide examples to support your solutions)
            Tufte’s redesign of the Space Shuttle Challenger data
                Bad data: looked like crayons in box
                Redesign: number damaged o-rings by temperature
            
            Data presentation on the consumption of sugary soda
                Context was important - eed to jog 50 minutes to burn calories of one soda

    Context and presentation increases understanding and can change behavior/attitude. 
        Caution: careful not to mislead/misinform!

    Data → Information → Knowledge
        What each of them are; difference between each of them

        Data: Uninterpreted information.
            
        Information: 
            contextualized data, 
            finding patterns
            associations
            relationships
            performing calculations on data
            
        KNowledge:
            Derived from extensive amounts of experience dealing with
            information that has been learned, analyzed, applied,
            and understood.
            
            historical patterns
            
    Data products
        Case studies 
            (case studies are used to provide context, 
             while no direct questions on these will be asked on the exam, 
             you can use them to provide examples to support your solutions)

        CD Database: A data product because new value was created
            from existing information. More data was generated
            as a result of the original data.

        Google Flu Tracking
            google searches on flu-related topics.
            Google spotted Swine Flu 2 weeks earlier than CDC

# GENERAL PYTHON CODING
'''
a.Be able to read code
b. Be able to show the output of a piece of code
c. Be able to compare two pieces of code
d. Describe the (many!) benefits of applying object-oriented principles
BENEFITS OF OOP
    * reusability
    * inheritance
    * consistency in the code abstraction of actual "object"

e. Describe what the major data structures are and their properties (and scenarios in
which they would be best suited – e.g. lists, dictionaries, and tuples)
    list
    
    dictionary

    tuple   
    
    int, long, bool, float, string, 
    list (mutable) ['dot','dash']; [], 
    tuple (immutable) ('dot', 'dash'); (); ("just one",), 
    dict {'key1':1, 'key2': 2}; {}, 
    file

f. Decide on an appropriate data structure(s) to use given the scenario
g. Correctly implement the appropriate data structure(s) for the given scenario and
manipulate data within this structure correctly and appropriately
h. Describe the major functions used and their properties (and scenarios in which they
would be best suited)
i. Explain some of the elements that results in “good quality” code
